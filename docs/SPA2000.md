# Configuring a Sipura SPA 2000

> **Note**
>
> Sipura were bought by Linksys, who were in turn bought by Cisco. These instructions may work for devices from those vendors.

## Configuration

SPA2000s can accept direct-dialled calls, and do not need to register with a PBX like Asterisk or FreeSWITCH. Access the web interface of the SPA2000, and switch to the **Admin Login** view.

Select the relevant **Line** that you want to configure - 1 or 2.

* Line Enable: yes
* SIP Port: 5060 (Line 1) or 5061 (Line 2) (or any other number you choose)
* (Proxy) Register: no
* (Proxy) Ans Call Without Reg: yes
* (Subscriber) User ID: speechbot
* (Audio) Preferred Codec: G711u
* **Submit All Changes**
The **User ID** does not have to be *speechbot*, it just has to be a unique string.

### Ring tones etcetera

These are left as an exercise for the user; they're accessible via the **Admin Login** in **advanced** mode - **Regional** tab.

## Getting the IP address

If you don't know the IP address of your SPA2000:
* pick up the handset (go off hook),
* dial `****` (four asterisks)
* wait for the IVR prompt
* dial `110#`
* hang up after noting down the IP address

If the address is not reachable with your current LAN configuration, you can set the device to DHCP

* pick up the handset,
* dial `****`
* dial `101#`
* dial `1#`
* hang up
* power cycle the device.
